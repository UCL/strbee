Notes on strbee
===============

cscript: H:\trtchg\strbee\update2011\strbee_cscript.do

stb version was 1.0, but with ipe options removed

1.1 counts recensored events (as well as recensored subjects)

TO DO:
======

9mar2015:
    Would be nice to be able to call for kmgraph (and generated values) for a given psi without having to run the estimation.
    strbee2 fails without endstudy variable - strangely, it requires it even if there is no censoring before stplitting

SEE Nick Latimer's email of 24/4/2014 with errors in ton, toff

also implement the weighted log rank test

is code adequate or should it be more modularised???

(from discussion with Richard Grieve, 19/9/2013): 2nd syntax using -stsplit- data to allow time-dependent quantitative compliance and offset
    e.g. strbee (trt = imm) xvars, offset(0.07*othertrt)
    where
        treatment variable trt could be
            0/1 if off/on trt,
            dose,
            could be multiplied by k in placebo arm to allow for treatment effect heterogeneity
        imm is the IV
        xvars are old adjvars
    syntax is like -ivregress-, but only 1 trt variable and 1 IV allowed
    this should allow same results with imm replaced by def! but would need care...

allow dist(gompertz) and all other streg dist() options

should hr use exp|weib when these are called?

more general kmgraph syntax?

add cluster() option!

noticed 20/9/2012:

    lower and upper bounds are sometimes the wrong way round!

    debug and trace

Nick Latimer, 17/12/12:
> For the IPE option, I understand that bootstrapping is best to get confidence intervals for psi. However, I was wondering what the easiest way to obtain confidence intervals for the HR associated with the IPE analysis would be? Would it require another bootstrapping run? Or could a test-based confidence interval be calculated?
i don't think you need *another* bootstrap run - you can get SE/CI for psi and HR from the same run (I've just checked, both are saved).
but yes, I think a test-based CI would be reasonable, though this is not explicitly given in any literature as far as I'm aware
> Here comes my main lack of knowledge though - if a test-based confidence interval could be used, how do I get the z statistic value for psi=0 for the IPE option? When I use savedta() under the IPE approach I don't get a z statistic value for psi=0. Would this just be the same as the z value given after fitting a Weibull model under an ITT analysis?
Yes, I think this is the right answer. In fact the z-statistic you need is the first z-statistic in the savedta() file, because the IPE algorithm first fits a weibull model to the observed data. It would be good if I coded this in -strbee-.
